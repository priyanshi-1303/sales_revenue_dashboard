Project Overview
This project involves developing an interactive sales dashboard for a Superstore dataset. The dashboard provides insights into revenue trends, sales performance, and category-wise analysis. The project also includes comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, outliers, and data-driven insights.

Key Highlights:
- Conducted EDA using Python to understand sales trends, revenue distribution, and category performance.
- Generated visualizations and summary reports to support data-driven decision making.
- Built interactive Power BI dashboards for easy visualization of insights.
- Demonstrated end-to-end workflow from raw data to visual insights.
